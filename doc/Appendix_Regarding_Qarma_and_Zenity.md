## Regarding Qarma and Zenity:

[Qarma](https://github.com/luebking/qarma) and [Zenity](https://github.com/GNOME/zenity) are at weird points of development. Zenity is considered by many
as "End of Life/Deprecated" and Qarma is very young, maintained by [luebking](https://github.com/luebking) alone (to my knowledge and by github's commit history).

That being said, I just love both of them. With Lenity and their projects, I was always able to code awesome little tools that I, [Gustavo H M Silva](https://gitlab.com/gustavohmsilva), use on my daily work as Video Operator at my company [Tesserato](http://tesserato.video).
